## Heading capitalization

W3C documents use headline-style capitalization (where every major word is capitalized) for document titles. Some also use headline-style capitalization for headings within the document (including h1, h2, etc.). Translations should use the proper capitaltion for your language.

## You
* Use formal form of "you".
* If you think the informal "you" is better in your language, please open a GitHub issue for gathering input from others.
* Background: [GitHub issue: "you" translate formal](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/123)
* (Example of "you" in a W3C WAI resource: <q>You may use this video if you include a link to this page.</q> ([in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/#permission)))

## W3C acronyms: W3C, WAI, HTML, WCAG, ARIA, EOWG, etc.

For W3C Working Group names and Technical Reports, translate the words written out. Leave the acronym in English. For example:

 _in English:_ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

_in German:_ Richtlinien f√ºr barrierefreie Webinhalte (WCAG)

## W3C terms capitalized

[W3C process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/)-related terms should be translated and capitalized.
This includes:
* Groups: Working Group, Interest Group, Business Group, Community Group, Task Force.
* W3C bodies: W3C Members, Team, Advisory Board, Advisory Committee, Technical Architecture Group
* Technical Reports: Working Group Note, Interest Group Note, Working Draft, First Public Working Draft, Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation, Candidate Recommendation.

Note: W3C Members are organizations. Individuals in groups are "participants" in a group (not "members" of a group).
